The topic of my thesis is the implementation of an electronic prescription system (E-Recipe)


The main goal of the project is to create an application enabling
electronic dispensing and management of prescriptions.

A person, either a doctor or a patient has to create an account in the system.
The patient needs a prescription, so he/she "reserves" a prescription in the system.
The prescription contains the prescribed medication, dosage, date of prescription and
expiry date.

An electronic prescription system will allow doctors to create prescriptions more easily and quickly, minimize errors associated with manual processing of paper
prescriptions and improve the monitoring and management of patient treatment.
